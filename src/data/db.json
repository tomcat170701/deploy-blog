      "body": "Baccarat Rouge 540 eau de parfum is born from the encounter between Maison Francis Kurkdjian and Baccarat to celebrate the crystal manufacturer’s 250th birthday. The woody scent releases a poetic alchemy, a highly condensed and graphic olfactory signature. Breezy jasmine facets, radiant saffron boost the ambergris mineral notes and the woody tones of freshly-cut cedar. Bright and sleek, Baccarat Rouge 540 eau de parfum caresses the skin like an amber and woody floral whisper. To enjoy a moment of well-being and prolong the sillage of your fragrance, add these other Baccarat Rouge 540 scented creations to your beauty ritual: hand and body cleansing gel, body oil, hair mist and solid soap."
